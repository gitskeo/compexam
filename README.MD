General Notes *[Django Secret key Generator [https://djecrety.ir/] 
Web app created is a prototype to simulate customer experience.  Two apps needed to be made.
Accounts was created using Custom User forms.  This is so we can capture all the data needed to send emails to the customer.  
The shop App was also created to host the tables and views for the shopping app as well as the check out and address.  The information captured by the customer creating an acccount for tracking allows us to auto-populate the information for the customer to check out with.  A link to the payment system will need to be added into the webpage.  With the data captured using these models we should be able to create the texting service, email for ads and completing the info needed for sending reciepts.
